Hi there,

These are some of my examples of code I've written for my C programming class in the Fall Semester of 2017.
Assignments and Labs were done mostly concurrently, so please check the dates on the headers of the 
  files for an accurate assessment of when I completed them.
The point of having them here is so you can see my style and how I've improved over time.
Most of them won't run becuase they are missing other parts that I have saved, 
  if you wish to see the executables please let me know.
  
Thanks,
Michael
